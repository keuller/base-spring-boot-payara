Simple integration application Spring-Boot and Payara Micro

I've made a simple project that uses Spring-Boot and Payara Micro.

Just run ```run-payara``` script to build and run the container. After start point out browser to address ```http://localhost:9000/payara-spring-boot/friends``` to see the response from sample service.

I hope you enjoy it.
